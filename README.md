Array, Recursive Addition


Description:
============
Write a computer program that sums the first N elements of the following array using a recursive function.
Your program must first prompt the user to enter a value between 1 and 10. Then your program must use this integer as a parameter to a recursive function that computes the sum of the N integers in the array. 
Finally, your program must display the results.
int myarray[10] = {23, 45, 12, 67, 34, 90, 1, 75, 3, 6};


Output:
=======
	This program sums up the first N elements of an array (N<=10).
	Array = [23, 45, 12, 67, 34, 90, 1, 75, 3, 6]
	
	Enter an integer between  1 and 10: 25
	Error. Integer is out of range.
	
	Enter an integer between  1 and 10: -1
	Error. Integer is out of range.
	
	Enter an integer between  1 and 10: 5
	
	Total of first 5 elements: 181
